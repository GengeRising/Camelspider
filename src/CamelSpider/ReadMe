This directory contains source code of CamelSpider---the tool described in the paper. The set of benchmark programs are also in this directory.

First, you need to set JVM arguments "-Xmx2048m -Xss256m", in order to allocate 2 GiB heap space and 256 MiB stack space for the tool. You may change the numbers as you wish.

You may also need to add the the JAR files in the folder "/Camelspider 2/external/" into your CLASSPATH.

Source files are located at "/Camelspider 2/src/camelspider", where "Main.java" contains the main class.

In order to apply Camelspider on a Java program you must pass the following arguments to the tool:
	"--w"				to activate whole jimple mode of Soot,
	"--f J"				to set output file format as JIMPLE intermediate representation
	"--d [path, e.g. /home/ali/]"	to specify output path to place ".jimple" files
	"--cp [path, e.g. /home/ali/]"	to specify class path for the input program
	"--p cg.spark enabled:true"	to enable SPARK---a context-insensitive points-to analysis
	"--p cg.cha enabled:false"	to disable off-the-self CHA analysis of Soot
	"--src-prec java"		to set preferred input file extension as .java
	"main class of the program"	the name of the main class of the program under analysis goes here, e.g. weblech.ui.TextSpider
Note: if you need to specify additional JAR files, you may pass their names by using "--cp" option. Please note that you may separate different paths by using a colon.

Thank you.
